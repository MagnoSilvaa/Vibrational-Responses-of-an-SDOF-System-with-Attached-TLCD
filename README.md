# Vibrational-Responses-of-an-SDOF-System-with-Attached-TLCD
The purpose of the experiment was to collect data for application in Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to assess its feasibility for analyzing vibrations. This approach aimed to explore how SSA could be used to identify and quantify vibration frequencies in a mechanical system with an attached Tuned Liquid Column Damper (TLCD). The experiment's excitation was achieved using a mini shaker (The Modal Shop, model K2007E01) with an integrated amplifier. Vibrational oscillations were captured using an accelerometer (PCB Piezotronics, model 333B30), which has a sensitivity of 10.2 mV/(m/s^2), a measurement range of Â±490 m/s^2 pk, and a frequency range of 0.5 to 3000 Hz. Data acquisition and storage were performed using the SPIDER-80X system and the Engineering Data Management System software, version 8.1.0.1 (Crystal Instruments).
